##Overview of the project

###Project:Finite State Machine (FSM) Design

###Objective
The objective of this project is to model a systemâ€™s behavior using a finite number of states and transitions, ensuring all possible inputs are handled. This helps in simplifying complex systems and managing their operations effectively.

###Key Activities:
-State Identification: Define all distinct states the system can be in.
-Transition Mapping: Determine how the system transitions between states based on inputs or events.
-Action Specification: Specify actions or outputs associated with each state or transition.
-State Diagram Creation: Draw a state diagram to visually represent states, transitions, and actions.

  ##Technologies Used
-State Diagrams: Visualize states and transitions.
-State Tables: Define states, inputs, transitions, and actions in tabular form.
-State Encoding: Assign binary codes to states.
-Moore and Mealy Machines: Two types of FSMs; outputs based on states (Moore) or states and inputs (Mealy).
-Flowcharts: Depict state transition logic.
-Simulation and Testing: Validate FSM behavior with tools.
-Minimization: Reduce the number of states and transitions.
-Hierarchical State Machines: Simplify complex FSMs with state hierarchies.
